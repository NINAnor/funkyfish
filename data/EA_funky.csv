"1","A Comparison of Egg Funnel and Egg Bag Estimates of Egg Deposition in Grand Traverse Bay, Lake Michigan","NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT",2011,"Reefs are used for spawning by Great Lakes fishes such as the lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis, and cisco C. artedi. We designed egg funnels as a new type of sampling gear for quantifying egg deposition while minimizing losses of eggs to physical disturbance and predation. Egg funnels were compared with traditionally used egg bags to quantify egg deposition by spawning fish. In addition, the efficiencies of the egg funnels and egg bags were measured by seeding each gear type with artificial lake trout and lake whitefish eggs in situ. Egg funnels were as efficient as or more efficient than egg bags for capturing artificial eggs and naturally deposited lake trout eggs in both 2008 and 2009. Egg funnels had lower efficiency than egg bags for capture of natural coregonid eggs in 2008, potentially due to avoidance of the gear by spawners; gear avoidance was reduced by burying the egg funnels more deeply in 2009. Accurate estimates of egg deposition will assist fisheries managers in making more-informed decisions for management actions, such as stocking strategies and habitat protection.","10.1080/02755947.2011.598421","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1080/02755947.2011.598421","43.85545","-87.08198","Salvelinus namaycush"

"5","A specialised cannibalistic Arctic charr morph in the piscivore guild of a subarctic lake","HYDROBIOLOGIA",2016,"Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) is generally considered an inferior piscivore compared to brown trout (Salmo trutta). However, we demonstrate that a recently described profundal spawning piscivore PP-morph of Arctic charr in a subarctic lake has evolved typical piscivore traits (i.e. large jaws, robust skulls), similar to the co-occurring brown trout but different from the sympatric littoral spawning omnivore LO-morph of Arctic charr. A few large-sized LO-morph, most large-sized PP-morph and trout constitute the piscivore guild, but they differed in prey fish selection. Of the fish-eating deep-water PP-morph, 52% had consumed charr, with a peak during the polar night period (68-80% in November-January). In contrast, the LO-morph and trout were mainly (similar to 90%) inter-specific piscivores eating stickleback. Consequently, the PP-morph was the main charr predator and started to feed on fish at a smaller size and took larger prey relative to their body length than the trout. Stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15) ratios reflect the dietary specialisations in the upper-water (LO-morph, trout) and the deep-water (PP-morph) environments, besides the piscivorous behaviour of the PP-morph and trout. The existence of a shallow-water piscivore (trout) may explain the origin of this PP-morph, taking benefit of underutilised resources of small-sized Arctic charr in the deep-water habitat.","10.1007/s10750-015-2601-x","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10750-015-2601-x.pdf","69.951757","19.155429","Salvelinus alpinus"

More than 80% of eggs survived in a reference lake with well-buffered groundwater and adequate discharge rates. These results suggest that both low pH and low groundwater flow rates may contribute to brook trout egg mortality.

"8","Acoustic estimates of abundance and distribution of spawning lake trout on Sheboygan Reef in Lake Michigan","JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH",2009,"Efforts to restore self-sustaining lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) populations in the Laurentian Great Lakes have had widespread success in Lake Superior; but in other Great Lakes, populations of lake trout are maintained by stocking. Recruitment bottlenecks may be present at a number of stages of the reproduction process. To study eggs and fry, it is necessary to identify spawning locations, which is difficult in deep water. Acoustic sampling can be used to rapidly locate aggregations of fish (like spawning lake trout), describe their distribution, and estimate their abundance. To assess these capabilities for application to lake trout, we conducted an acoustic survey covering 22 km(2) at Sheboygan Reef, a deep reef (<40 m summit) in southern Lake Michigan during fall 2005. Data collected with remotely operated vehicles (ROV) confirmed that fish were large lake trout, that lake trout were 1-2 m above bottom, and that spawning took place over specific habitat. Lake trout density exhibited a high degree of spatial structure (autocorrelation) up to a range of similar to 190 m, and highest lake trout and egg densities occurred over rough substrates (rubble and cobble) at the shallowest depths sampled (36-42 m). Mean lake trout density in the area surveyed (similar to 2190 ha) was 5.8 fish/ha and the area surveyed contained an estimated 9500-16,000 large lake trout. Spatial aggregation in lake trout densities, similarity of depths and substrates at which high lake trout and egg densities occurred, and relatively low uncertainty in the lake trout density estimate indicate that acoustic sampling can be a useful complement to other sampling tools used in lake trout restoration research.

"9","Aerial Application of Organic Pellets Eliminates Lake Trout Recruitment from a Primary Spawning Reef in Yellowstone Lake","NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT",2023,"Invasive Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush in the Yellowstone Lake ecosystem have been gillnetted since 1995 to suppress the population and allow for recovery of native Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri. Although gillnetting is effective (Lake Trout population growth rate lambda <= 0.6 during 2012-2022), the effort only targets free-swimming, age-2 and older Lake Trout. We developed a complementary suppression method using organic (soy and wheat) pellets to cause Lake Trout embryo mortality and reduce recruitment from spawning areas. The entire Carrington Island spawning reef (0.5 ha) was aerially treated with 3.56 and 3.00 kg/m(2) of pellets in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Pellet decomposition caused dissolved oxygen concentrations to decline to lethal levels at 20 cm depth in the substrate, and pellets mostly dissipated from the reef within 12 d. Lake Trout fry trap CPUE was reduced to zero after ice-off each spring after the treatments. Prior to the treatments, 71 fry were captured during 58 trap-nights of effort in 2017-2019. After the treatments, no fry were captured during 273 trap-nights in 2020 and 2021. Lake Trout CPUE in large-mesh gill nets set near Carrington Island in September did not decline during 2017-2021 and fry were again trapped on the reef in spring 2022, suggesting that adults were not deterred from spawning there in the years after the pellet treatments. Complementary methods that increase mortality of prerecruits may allow for a reduction in gill-netting effort and the long-term costs of maintaining Lake Trout population suppression in Yellowstone Lake. Treatment of spawning areas may improve suppression efficiency for Lake Trout and invasive fish populations elsewhere because entire cohorts are targeted while immobile and temporarily concentrated in relatively small areas.","10.1002/nafm.10872",NA,"44.455003","-110.360777","Salvelinus namaycush"

Brook charr were apparently attracted to groundwater seeping up through the aggregation and utilized the tangle of various sized sticks as a spawning substrate. Eggs were deposited in late October and alevins emerged from the area in late March, periods that coincide with the conventional spawning of native brook charr on gravel areas in nearby lakes. Our observations support the contention that upwellin, water is more important than bottom type in stimulating brook charr to select a spawning site.","10.1007/bf00005574","https://lens.org/083-006-621-559-594","45.659587","-78.053856","Salvelinus fontinalis"

Traditional fry traps are constructed with a welded iron base and riveted walls and are therefore heavy and bulky as well as expensive. We describe an inexpensive new design with a semi-rigid base and soft, fabric walls that requires few specialized tools for construction. The soft design and light weight of the traps allow for easy stacking and transport. The weight can also be adjusted to suit sampling requirements. We deployed 15 rigid and 14 soft fry traps at two sites in Lake Champlain, Vermont and New York. Of the 286 fry collected, 187 were collected in rigid traps and 99 in soft traps. The numbers of fry collected per unit effort did not differ significantly between rigid and soft traps at either site. At one site, significantly greater numbers of soft traps than rigid traps contained fry (chi-square test, P < 0.0005). The new fry trap design provides a convenient, inexpensive method for determining locations of salmonid hatch and for estimating relative fry production.","10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<1321:AIMEFT>2.0.CO;2",NA,"44.33413","-73.31610","Salvelinus namaycush"
"19","Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) squeezed in a complex fish community dominated by perch (Perca fluviatilis)","Fauna norvegica",2013,"In the complex fish community of Lake Skasen, southeastern Norway, the relative population density, habitat use and diet of Arctic charr, perch, roach and burbot was studied by a gill net survey during June-September 2010. A marked segregation in habitat use was observed, with Arctic charr and burbot captured in the profundal and deepest part of the pelagic habitat, and perch and roach captured in the littoral and upper part of the pelagic. Perch dominated the total catches, followed by roach. Arctic charr occurred in low numbers in the catches, and also had a low annual growth rate. Even in June, at low water temperatures, Arctic charr were confined to the profundal. Both Arctic charr, roach and perch fed on the same cladocerans, but all size groups of perch had fish as an important part of the diet. Analysis of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes revealed a narrow trophic niche of Arctic charr, positioned at the extreme pelagic end of the carbon gradient relative to the other fish species. These had a wider span of Î´13C signatures, but more positioned towards the littoral end of the carbon gradient. The low growth rate of Arctic charr, despite a low population density, indicates that food is a limiting resource for charr in this lake, probably due to a confinement to the profundal habitat as a result of competition and predator avoidance. Since all age-classes of Arctic charr seem to be enclosed in the profundal habitat, intraspecific competition and predation may be supplementary stressors resulting in low annual recruitment and low population density, as well as low individual growth rate, i.e. the population is squeezed. The narrow trophic niche of Arctic charr compared to perch, roach and burbot, revealed by stable isostope analysis, supports this conclusion.","10.5324/fn.v33i0.1579","https://lens.org/074-457-158-116-13X","60.394853","12.314228","Salvelinus alpinus"

The main objective of this study was to determine if trap data could be used to index egg abundance in spawning substrate. In 1990 and 1992 the number of eggs captured in traps on a reef in Lake Ontario was compared to the egg abundance in cobble substrate adjacent to each trap. Linear regression models indicated that the relationship between eggs captured in traps and egg abundance varied significantly, both among depth transects within years and between years (P < 0.05). However, within a given year, egg capture in traps generally increased as egg abundance increased. Wind-induced waves and water currents probably affected the proportion of eggs that were dislodged from the substrate and drifted into traps or off the reef and caused much of the variation observed in the eggs . trap-1-egg abundance relationship. Different substrate size and interstitial depth may also explain some of the within year variation among trap sites. Trap data should not be used to compare egg abundance among different Great Lakes spawning areas unless data interpretation includes sources of variation such as water currents and substrate type. Comparison of trap data among years for the same spawning area should only be made among years with similar water currents.

Hydroacoustic data indicate that most Arctic charr routinely avoid the upper 10 m of the water column irrespective of temperature, with the implication that an observed gradual warming of the lake has not yet directly impacted upon their habitat. 4. In recent years there has been a behavioural response of the Arctic charr population to migrate vertically to avoid oxygen concentrations <2.3â€“3.1 mg Lâˆ’1. Further, the depth of the lower bound of the Arctic charr population is shown to be highly correlated with the deep water oxygen concentration throughout the year prior to autumnal overturn","10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01902.x",NA,"54.335043","-2.942201","Salvelinus alpinus"
"22","Assessment of the feasibility of preventing reproduction of lake charr, Salvelinus namaycush, in shallow areas of reservoirs affected by drawdowns","ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES",2002,"Lake charr, Salvelinus namaycush, spawn almost exclusively in lakes, in the fall. Spawning sites in inland lakes are generally located close to the shore in areas with coarse-textured substrate, and in depths of less than 2 m. Because of the type of water management system applied in reservoirs where water levels are lowered during the winter, eggs deposited during the fall around the shallow shoreline of reservoirs can be exposed. The depth of spawning sites relative to drawdowns may be a limiting factor for lake charr survival in reservoirs. In 1995 and 1996, we evaluated the ability to induce lake charr reproduction in deeper water, below the range of fluctuating water levels by the sequential construction of artificial reefs and limiting access to natural spawning habitat. The creation of artificial deeper water spawning areas, adjacent to natural sites, produced a partial transfer of reproduction. However when natural spawning sites were covered with tarpaulins almost all the eggs were laid in the artificial deeper water spawning areas. Complete or partial transfer of reproduction activities to sites below the depth not affected by water level fluctuations is therefore a potential way of alleviating the effects of hydroelectric reservoir management.","10.1007/978-94-017-1352-8_28","https://lens.org/034-697-805-424-625","46.8588","-72.3986","Salvelinus namaycush"

bouvieri in Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park, where gill nets have been used to suppress subadult and
adult Lake Trout since 1995. However, survival of embryonic and larval life history stages can have profound effects
on the population dynamics of Lake Trout. Inducing additional mortality at those stages, especially if used in concert
with intensive gillnetting of older fish, could enhance overall suppression efforts. Therefore, we conducted controlled
field experiments at Yellowstone Lake to systematically evaluate the effects of sediment deposition and ground Lake
Trout carcass deposition on Lake Trout embryos in pre-positioned incubators. Sediment deposition caused dissolved
oxygen concentrations to decline below lethal levels for a prolonged overwinter period (92 d). Embryo mortality
among overwintering incubators varied from 97.0 ± 5.3% (mean ± SE) at the substrate surface to 100.0 ± 0.0% at 20
cm below the substrate surface. Decomposition of ground carcass material on spawning sites caused dissolved oxygen
concentrations to decline to lethal levels (<3.4 mg/L) for about 9 d after biomass application rates of 14 and 28 kg/m2
in treatment plots. Exposure to ground carcass material resulted in 100.0 ± 0.0% embryo mortality at the substrate
surface and within interstices 20 cm below the surface in 14- and 28-kg/m2 biomass treatments. Embryo mortality was
probably caused by hypoxic conditions within substrates in both experiments. The deposition of sediment and ground
Lake Trout carcass material on Lake Trout spawning sites in Yellowstone Lake could provide an additional source of
mortality in ongoing Lake Trout suppression efforts. These methods may also be beneficial in other systems when
incorporated in an integrated pest management approach targeting multiple life history stages of invasive freshwater

A similar vertical distribution of eggs (16-20 cm) and substrate occurred in the stream; however, in addition to the digging action of the female, the flow conditions in the stream appeared to produce coarser surface sediment conditions. Groundwater offered a high concentration of dissolved oxygen and, relative to lake water, less variable temperature and pH regimes for incubating eggs.

Ten-metre sectors of shoreline were first visually assessed and classified by pairs of naive and expert observers. Lake trout were then displaced from their traditional spawning sites and forced to choose new sites from a 2050-m section of previously classified shoreline. Forty-one sectors from the test area were selected by the displaced fish for spawning. Egg deposition was restricted to 63 patches (0.25-5.0 m(2)) of substrate (2-30 cm) within the sectors. An estimated 298-551 female lake trout used a total surface area of 53.4 m(2) for egg deposition. Observers were able to correctly classify 59-76% of the shoreline sectors containing egg patches, but their success rate was mainly because of the high number of sites they selected. The study showed that traditional assessment methods are useful for large-scale habitat mapping, but precise predictions of the location of individual spawning sites may not be possible.

Given the recent development of novel suppression methods, such as use of carcass-analog pellets to cause high-mortality of embryos, there was a need to quantify spawning season aggregation sites, site use, and spawning habitat for Lake Trout in Swan Lake. Acoustic tags were implanted in 85 Lake Trout during the summer of 2018 and 2019. Nightly tracking efforts during autumn in both years resulted in 1,744 relocations for 49 individual Lake Trout. Kernel-density analysis was used to evaluate Lake Trout aggregation sites identifying 10 distinct spawning sites. All spawning sites were located in the littoral zone along areas of steep bathymetric relief and composed 48% of total relocations during both spawning seasons. In 2019, side-scan sonar imaging was used to classify and quantify the total area of spawning substrate, which composed 12.8% of the total surface area estimated for spawning sites 1, 6, and 9, and 11.4% for aggregation sites 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10. Simultaneous treatment of all spawning sites would require 205,709 Â± 86 kg of carcass-analog pellet material, resulting in 370.4 Â± 0.2 kg of phosphorous and 7,487.9 Â± 3.1 kg of nitrogen inputs to Swan Lake. Thus, pellet treatment would increase the Carlson's trophic state index (TSI) values from 20.8 to 27.7 for total phosphorous, and from 22.1 to 26.2 for total nitrogen. Based on a TSI threshold of < 40 for an oligotrophic lake, the use of carcass-analog pellets could be feasible for supplementing the gillnetting suppression of Lake Trout in Swan Lake.","10.1002/nafm.10855","https://lens.org/047-860-736-567-401","47.941889","-113.878542","Salvelinus namaycush"

Survival to hatch was significantly higher in the laboratories and averaged 80.9%. In Lake Superior, egg survival among incubators at all sites was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) for incubators that remained buried in spawning substrates (15.1-21.0%) than for incubators that were partially or completely exposed to water currents (1.0-12.6%). Egg survival for incubators that remained buried at the shallow-water sites was significantly higher at Bark Point (44.6%) than at Gull Island Shoal (21.0%). Egg survival among incubators that remained buried at the deep (14.4%) and shallow-water sites (21.0%) on Gull Island Shoal was not significantly different. Because incubators that were completely buried or partially exposed only appeared to differ in their degree of exposure, we concluded that survival of eggs in the lake was reduced by mechanical stress associated with water turbulence. Lower egg survival at Gull Island Shoal, a known lake trout-spawning site, was not expected and appeared to have been caused by a strong gale that occurred when these eggs were in late epiboly, a sensitive embryological stage. We present a hypothesis suggesting that lake trout recruitment in the Great Lakes is limited by availability of spawning habitat.","10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71105-4",NA,"47.765779","-87.477192","Salvelinus namaycush"
"47","Contrasting life history strategies of sympatric Arctic charr morphs, Salvelinus alpinus","Journal of Ichthyology",2013,"In polymorphic populations morphs usually diverge in morphology, ecology and life history, which is most likely driven by adaptations to different environments or resources. Sympatric morphs may develop differences in several life history traits to be able to maximize fitness in alternative niches and habitats. Here, the contrasting life history traits of three sympatric Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) morphs in a deep and oligotrophic lake in sub-arctic Norway are addressed. The charr morphs differ in spawning habitat and trophic niche. One is a littoral spawning morph that feeds on benthic invertebrates and zooplankton in the littoral and pelagic zones (referred to as the LO-morph), and two other are profundal spawning morphs that either utilize profundal soft bottom benthos as food resource (the PB-morph) or are piscivorous (the PP-morph). The LO-morph typically had intermediate life-history traits relative to the two profundal morphs that had highly contrasting life history traits, especially in growth and age and size of maturity. The PB-morph matured at a young age (âˆ¼3 years) and at a small body size (âˆ¼8.5 cm), thereby increasing their fitness by investing in reproduction early in life, which results in a short generation time and decreased probability of being predated before first reproduction. The PP-morph on the other hand, matured at an old age (âˆ¼9.2 years) and a large body size (âˆ¼26 cm), thereby increasing their fitness by investing in somatic growth to enhance initial fecundity, and also to reach a large body size profitable for piscivory. The different trade-off regime between the PP- and PB-morphs seems to be caused by adaptation to alternative trophic niches, and appears to be an important factor for the co-occurrence of the two sister-morphs in the profundal zone.","10.1134/s0032945213100111","https://lens.org/044-796-715-230-970","69.951757","19.155429","Salvelinus alpinus"

To determine whether reproductive success varied among strains, embryos and fry from three sites in the eastern basin and four sites in the western basin of Lake Ontario were generically characterized with allozyme electrophoresis at 18 polymorphic loci. These data and data from previous studies were used To estimate by mired-stock analysis (MSA) the strain composition of parents that contributed to the embryo andfry mixture samples. In the eastern basin of Lake Ontario, the parental contributor to embryos andfry at three of the four spawning sites was primarily the Seneca strain (73-95%); Superior/Killala and Manitou strains contributed to a lesser extent (0-13%) and the Clearwater and Jenny strains were nearly absent from the estimates (< 2%). Strain contributions at the fourth eastern spawning area were different: Seneca-10%, Superior/Killala-43%, Manitou-43%, Clearwater-2%, and Jenny-1%. In the western basin, parental contributors to embryos were similar at three spawning sites; Seneca and Superior/Killala each contributed 33-48% with the balance divided among the other three strains. At the fourth western spawning area, the Seneca strain was absent, and contributions from the Clearwater Manitou, and Superior/Killala strains each varied between 15 and 44% depending upon the year. Differences in strain composition among lake trout embryos from spawning sites 10-50 km apart and the temporal consistency of strain compositions at two sites where embryos or fry were collected over 3-7 years indicated that the criterion adult fish used to select spawning sites varied among strains. The Superior/Killala strain consistently contributed less than lake-wide stocking rates predicted, but the Seneca strain usually contributed more. Contributions from the Jenny, Manitou, and Clearwater strains were inconclusive because of low expected and observed values. The Seneca strain's greater overall contribution indicates that stocking more of the Seneca strain may increase the potential for natural reproduction. The minimal contribution of the Seneca strain at two of the eight spawning sites, however, suggests that other strains should continue to be stocked to make use of spawning habitat not used by the Seneca strain.","10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71110-8",NA,"43.652042","-77.732648","Salvelinus namaycush"

Twelve demonstrated or putative spawning grounds of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) in shallow and deep areas of the north and south basins of the eutrophicated lake of Windermere, UK, were described by hydroacoustic, physical and visual surveys. In addition, their current conditions were compared with their original qualitative descriptions made over 50 years ago. Spawning ground characteristics were found to be more complex than originally described, with considerable overlaps in depth ranges and only limited areas of appropriate hard substrates. Moreover, extensive gill netting surveys in recent years have found spawning Arctic charr at only seven of the original 12 demonstrated or putative spawning grounds, although several new spawning areas have also been found. The distribution of unsuitable fine sediments is widespread in the lake, particularly in the more eutrophicated south basin where suitable spawning habitat within the putative spawning areas is limited. Windermere faces a number of environmental problems including climate change and species introductions. However, the temporal and spatial patterns of the lake's eutrophication suggest that associated increases in fine sediments have been a major driver of the observed deterioration of Arctic charr spawning grounds and so may have also contributed to a marked decline recently observed in the local abundance of this species.","10.1111/eff.12122","https://lens.org/093-730-327-661-213","54.335043","-2.942201","Salvelinus alpinus"

Quantitative studies of survival between egg deposition and fry emergence were conducted on a spawning reef in the eastern basin of Lake Ontario to determine variables associated with poor reproduction of hatchery-origin lake trout. Thirty to 90 mesh bags were buried in the substrate of Stony Island Reef in 1990, 1991, and 1992 to collect eggs and fry. Bags were retrieved on three dates over the six month period between the end of spawning and fry emergence. Mean egg abundance in the substrate increased significantly (P < 0.01) from 700 m(-2) in 1990 to 3,572 m(-2) In 1991 and 3,355 m(-2) in 1992. Change in egg abundance probably resulted from an increase in the proportion of Seneca strain spawners, rather than an increase in the total number of admits in the eastern basin. Mean embryo survival from spawning to late November or early December was 45% (range, 27-57%), approximately 7.5% (range, 7.4-7.5%) to mid-April, and about 3% (range, 1.8-3.9%) to the time of emergence in mid-May. Much of the early mortality of fertilized eggs was probably due to physical shock caused by water currents during storms. Mortality later in development was caused by predation and possibly poor incubation quality of substrate along the base of the reef due to sedimentation. A life history model for lake trout in Lake Ontario was developed and parameters set with the levels of fertilization and egg-to-fry survival rate estimated in this study. Other parameters were estimated from stocking rates and previous studies. Model output indicated that the current lake trout population has the potential to produce over 1.2 million age-1 fish annually. No evidence exists for this level of recruitment in Lake Ontario. Natural recruitment may be limited by a low proportion of eggs incubating in suitable substrate and/or low survival of fry to age-1. These problems could be due to a combination of 1) a limited amount of spawning habitat, 2) ineptitude of some strains to locate ol recognize spawning habitat, 3) disease-related mortality during the swim-up life stage, and 4) mortality from fish predation shortly after swim-lip. Managers need to reconsider current strategies and time requirements necessary to achieve restoration goals and objectives for lake trout in Lake Ontario.","10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71113-3",NA,"43.652042","-77.732648","Salvelinus namaycush"

or gravel piles with rainbow trout eggs attracted more mottled sculpins than those without eggs was
determined next. Rock piles seeded with rainbow trout eggs for 1 to 3 days did not contain more mottled
sculpins than piles without eggs. Mottled sculpins from rubble piles were larger and had more eggs in
their stomachs than mottled sculpins from gravel piles. Laboratory feeding by mottled sculpins on lake
trout eggs indicated that the maximum number of items consumed was approximately proportional to fish
body volume (i.e., approximately proportional to length cubed). The relationship between eggs consumed
and length of mottled sculpin was similar to that documented for mottled sculpins collected from rock

We exposed the eggs of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush to blasts from an open-pit mine at Lac de Gras, Northwest Territories, and measured the effects on egg mortality. Twenty Plexiglas incubators, each containing 50 eggs, were placed in the lake substrate at four sites; blast-monitoring equipment was also positioned at these sites. Three sites were within 220 in of the pit's dike, in a zone where PPVs were predicted to exceed the guidelines. A reference site was located outside of this blast zone 2 km away from the pit. Substrate at one of the blast zone sites was composed of material used in dike construction, whereas other sites were natural spawning shoals. To assess egg mortality during the period of greatest egg sensitivity to physical disturbance, half of the incubators were retrieved after 20 d; the remaining incubators were retrieved at ice-out. After 20 d, mortality at two of the three blast zone sites was lower than reference mortality, whereas mortality at the third site did not differ from the reference level. At ice-out, the single blast zone site with nonnatural substrate had higher mortality (by 10%) than the reference site. Ice-out mortality at the other two blast zone sites was similar to that of the reference site. Given that the largest blast exposure (28.5 mm/s) throughout the incubation period was more than double the current maximum allowable limit but still produced mortality similar to the reference level, we suggest that existing guidelines provide ample protection under these blasting conditions.

Repeated surveys throughout the spawning season allowed us to fit an individually based parametric model and estimate the day of year on which spawning was initiated, reached its midpoint, and ended during each year. Spawning phenology was then assessed relative to (1) mean of maximum daily air temperature and (2) mean of maximum daily water temperature at the lake bottom during summer in each year using a linear model. Elevated temperatures in summer were correlated with a delay in spawning and a reduction in the total number of redds constructed. Increasing the summer mean of maximum daily air temperatures by 1 degrees C delayed spawning by approximately 1week and decreased the total number of redds constructed by nearly 65. Lake spawning brook trout select redd sites based on the presence of discharging groundwater that is relatively constant in temperature within and across years, leading to relatively consistent egg incubation times. Therefore, delayed spawning is likely to delay fry emergence, which could influence emergence synchrony with prey items. This work highlights non-lethal and sub-lethal effects of elevated summer temperatures on native resident salmonids in aquatic environments with limited thermal refugia.","10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02670.x",NA,"43.966280","-74.870320","Salvelinus fontinalis"

reproductively isolated because they spawn 5 months apart. The smaller morph (14 cm LF)
is confined to the profundal zone of the lake and the larger morph is mainly littoral. Three
hypotheses were tested: (i) the offspring of the profundal Arctic charr grow slower than the
offspring of the littoral Arctic charr under identical conditions, thus indicating a genetic basis
for the slow growth of the profundal Arctic charr in the wild; (ii) the wild phenotypes of the two
morphs are morphometrically different and the differences are persistent in the offspring; (iii)
the offspring of the two morphs have different behaviour traits under similar treatments. The
first hypothesis was rejected; offspring of the profundal morph grew slightly better than
offspring of the littoral morph at 10 C in the laboratory. The second and third hypotheses
were supported by the data. Wild-caught fish of the two morphs differed in several
morphometric characters and most of the differences persisted in the offspring. In the
laboratory, offspring of the littoral morph were more active, more aggressive and more pelagic
than offspring of the profundal morph and naive offspring of the profundal morph were more

As part of an effort to restore Lake Michigan's lake trout, which were extirpated in the 1950s, yearling lake trout have been released over the MLRC since the mid-1980s and fall gill net censuses began to show large numbers of lake trout in spawning condition beginning about 1999. We report the first evidence of viable egg deposition and successful lake trout fry production at these deep reefs. Because the area's existing bathymetry and habitat were too poorly known for a priori selection of sampling sites, we used hydroacoustics to locate concentrations of large fish in the fall; fish were congregating around slopes and ridges. Subsequent observations via unmanned submersible confirmed the large fish to be lake trout. Our technological objectives were driven by biological objectives of locating where lake trout spawn, where lake trout fry were produced, and what fishes ate lake trout eggs and fry. The unmanned submersibles were equipped with a suction sampler and electroshocker to sample eggs deposited on the reef, draw out and occasionally catch emergent fry, and collect egg predators (slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus). We observed slimy sculpin to eat unusually high numbers of lake trout eggs.

Previous telemetry work conducted near Drummond Island, USA, Lake Huron, identified egg presence in substrates at the base of large boulders (>1 m diameter); however, the extent of this phenomenon was unknown. Telemetry data paired with multi-beam bathymetry identified a 0.63 km(2) area used by lake trout characterized by low bathymetric relief and numerous (similar to 269) large boulders (>1 m diameter) with small-diameter substrates at their bases. Diver surveys revealed egg presence at all 40 boulders surveyed, exclusively associated with clean gravel-cobble (0.6-42 cm) substrates in undercut areas beneath overhanging edges of boulders and in narrow spaces between adjacent boulders. Egg presence was not associated with boulder or substrate physical characteristics which highlighted the possible importance of interstitial currents. Successful incubation in these habitats was inferred by capture of free embryos and post-embryos the following spring using traps and an electrofishing ROV although at lower densities than at popular spawning habitats nearby (1-3 km away). Free embryos and post-embryos were also caught where eggs were not observed the previous fall including unexpectedly on top of boulders which suggested that post-hatch stages may move more than previously thought. Extensive use of boulder-associated habitats for spawning, egg incubation, and early growth suggested this undescribed habitat type may provide an unanticipated contribution to total available lake trout spawning habitat and recruitment in the Great Lakes.

"85","Evolution of the spawning grounds of the Arctic char in Lake Geneva from 1981 to 2005","Archives des sciences",2005,"The capture of the Arctic Char in Lake Geneva is on the decrease since the year 2000, in spite of an important stocking effort In the 1980's the poor quality of the water in the lake probably did not allow for a significant success in the natural reproduction of this fish. On the other hand today, Lake Geneva being under way to re-oligotrophication, the eggs laid in the deep spawning ground sites should have more chance to hatch So that to check the evolution of the reproduction sites, the principal spawning ground sites of the Arctic Char were studied from 1981 to 2005, thanks to 69 dives (160 hours 22 minutes of observations) made by the submarine FA Fore! In Lake Geneva there are 9 sites of which each have one or several different spawning grounds These spawning grounds have the appearance of a great slide of gravel, stones and pebbles without any covering of sediment, which usually measure 1 to 5 cm in diameter, and are mostly situated between 50 and 120 metres deep. Maps of under water areas have been drawn up, which provides the exact position and location of these spawning grounds and their evolution in the course of time. The spawning grounds are mostly due to the outcome of the wilful immersion or not of gravel. This is the reason why many among them are situated in the lake below the quarries. Spawning grounds ofstrictly natural origin are rare because today the dynamic force of rivers is no longer able to drag gravel along and bring sufficient quantities of it to the depths of the lake. Certain spawning grounds seem remarkably stable in the course of time whereas others are more short-lived. Apparently 3 criteria appear fundamental to ensure the survival of a spawning ground (1) the constant provision of gravel, (2) the presence of water currents, (3) deep sites It is possible to re-create artificial spawning grounds by immerging gravel at certain places. This method may be very effective and the spawning grounds can be functional for several years. Hlowever without a constant supply of gravel they will become covered in silt after 3 or 4 years and the attractiveness of the surface, which draws the attention of the Arctic Char, will be reduced. Consequently, it is the intention to choose a few sites where, in turn, a certain quantity of clean gravel will be immersed each year, in order to propose a new fish management not only based on stocking but equally on the renaturation","10.5169/seals-738405","https://doi.org/10.5169/seals-738405","46.443634","6.487963","Salvelinus alpinus"
"86","Field activity of lake trout during the reproductive period monitored by electromyogram radiotelemetry","JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY",1996,"Many lake trout Salvelinus namaycush spawn in shallow areas along windswept shores. However, precise determination of time and location of spawning is limited by its nocturnal occurrence, and possibly by some postulated, but unproven, spawning in deep water by certain populations. In White Pine Lake, Ontario, a well-studied experimental lake, lake trout spawn in two shallow locations where some direct observation is possible. Radiotelemetry apparatus was used in 1991 to obtain records of the electromyograms (EMGs) produced by muscle activity in one adult male and one adult female lake trout, captured from the lake before their reproductive period and returned to the lake at the beginning of the spawning period. Both fish survived, though only the male was detected as active over the main spawning site, where it showed evening EMG activity patterns indicating considerable activity. At other rimes of day, when not located over the spawning site, but present elsewhere in the lake, the male's EMG (i.e. muscle) values were considerably reduced. At the cessation of the spawning period, the transmitter-equipped male's EMG record showed no further pattern indicative of high activity during what had formerly been the daily spawning period. The female was tracked as she moved around the lake, but based on both her location and level of EMG activity, is thought not to have spawned. In 1992, a second male was captured, equipped with a transmitter and released again. This fish failed to show spawning activity but, as with the 1991 female, moved fairly considerable distances in the lake. In one instance, in a swim of short duration (6 min), well away from the spawning: grounds, this fish displayed EMG activity levels resembling those of the high activity of spawning. The results obtained appear to demonstrate that EMG telemetry could be used to assess the level of muscular activity occurring in lake trout, especially in relation to reproductive behaviour, and when they cannot be directly observed.

As an alternative, we used fine-scale acoustic telemetry to locate, describe and compare lake trout spawning habitats. Adult lake trout were implanted with acoustic transmitters and tracked during five consecutive spawning seasons in a 19-27km(2) region of the Drummond Island Refuge, Lake Huron, using the VEMCO Positioning System. Acoustic telemetry revealed discrete areas of aggregation on at least five reefs in the study area, subsequently confirmed by divers to contain deposited eggs. Notably, several identified spawning sites would likely not have been discovered using traditional methods because either they were too small and obscure to stand out on a bathymetric map or because they did not conform to the conceptual model of spawning habitat held by many biologists. Our most unique observation was egg deposition in gravel and rubble substrates located at the base of and beneath overhanging edges of large boulders. Spawning sites typically comprised <10% of the reef area and were used consistently over the 5-year study. Evaluation of habitat selection from the perspective of fish behaviour through use of acoustic transmitters offers potential to expand current conceptual models of critical spawning habitat.","10.1111/eff.12373",NA,"44.893166","-82.455855","Salvelinus namaycush"
"92","Fish carcass deposition to suppress invasive lake trout through hypoxia causes limited, nonâ€target effects on benthic invertebrates in Yellowstone Lake","Aquaculture, Fish and Fisheries",2022,"Although the paleontological evidence is sketchy, the genus Salvelinus appears to have arisen some 5-10 million years (My) ago. During most of the last 0.6 My, and for a long period before that, the charrs existed in periglacial environments just beyond the fringes of great ice sheets. The charrs of eastern North America evolved and live in close and intimate association with ice in all its various natural forms. The aquatic environments in which they evolved were cold, unproductive, sediment laden, and often catastrophically unstable. Even during times like the current interglacial, seasonal ice conditions influence their environment. Ice can limit movement and confine fish during winter to groundwater fed refuge areas in rivers or to deep waters. In rivers, spawning grounds may be delimited by suitable groundwater upwellings needed to protect eggs and embryos from ice. In lakes, ice thickness and, often, groundwater upwellings help define suitable spawning areas which often occur in ice molded glacial deposits. Not surprisingly, many of the traits displayed by eastern North American charrs can be recognized as beneficial in cold regions. Particularly valuable is their opportunistic, exploratory, and migratory behaviour which helps define their life history. These traits were presumably selected during life in periglacial areas and would have been useful for dispersal whenever ice sheets retracted. It is unlikely these traits will promote survival under present circumstances when human activity is rapidly modifying their environment. However, should modern technology enable the necessary information to be obtained and, with guidance, society responds appropriately, it is possible the charrs will persist into the future.","10.1002/aff2.72","https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/1/17571/1/briggs-fish-2022.pdf","44.455003","-110.360777","Salvelinus namaycush"
"93","Five-year evaluation of habitat remediation in Thunder Bay, Lake Huron: Comparison of constructed reef characteristics that attract spawning lake trout","FISHERIES RESEARCH",2016,"Degradation of aquatic habitats has motivated construction and research on the use of artificial reefs to enhance production of fish populations. However, reefs are often poorly planned, reef design characteristics are not evaluated, and reef assessments are short-term. We constructed 29 reefs in Thunder Bay, Lake Huron, in 2010 and 2011 to mitigate for degradation of a putative lake trout spawning reef. Reefs were designed to evaluate lake trout preferences for height, orientation, and size, and were compared with two degraded natural reefs and a high-quality natural reef (East Reef). Eggs and fry were sampled on each reef for five years post-construction, and movements of 40 tagged lake trout were tracked during three spawning seasons using acoustic telemetry. Numbers of adults and spawning on the constructed reefs were initially low, but increased significantly over the five years, while remaining consistent on East Reef. Adult density, egg deposition, and fry catch were not related to reef height or orientation of the constructed reefs, but were related to reef size and adjacency to East Reef. Adult lake trout visited and spawned on all except the smallest constructed reefs. Of the metrics used to evaluate the reefs, acoustic telemetry produced the most valuable and consistent data, including fine-scale examination of lake trout movements relative to individual reefs. Telemetry data, supplemented with diver observations, identified several previously unknown natural spawning sites, including the high-use portions of-East Reef. Reef construction has increased the capacity for fry production in Thunder Bay without apparently decreasing the use of the natural reef. Results of this project emphasize the importance of multi-year reef assessment, use of multiple assessment methods, and comparison of reef characteristics when developing artificial reef projects. Specific guidelines for construction of reefs focused on enhancing lake trout spawning are suggested. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To address this, we studied the Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) from the postglacial lake Thingvallavatn (Iceland) through a multidisciplinary approach involving aerial surveys, behavioural observations, temperature monitoring and embryo rearing experiments. Aerial footage revealed that most nests (i.e. redds) were established in shallow parts of the spawning area, and we reported through direct observations trends for stronger male-male competition and for more frequent courtship behaviours in shallow than in deep redds. While water depth did not correlate with temperature at the time of spawning, the temperatures recorded at the shallow redds were consistently lower in the two months following the video recordings, likely because of the proximity of glacial outlets. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that the temperature regimes in shallow waters can delay hatching with about a month, likely impacting the phenology of the offspring. The viability of the Arctic charr in Thingvallavatn may thus depend on physical features like groundwater springs and upwelling water flows acting as ""temperature shelters"".","10.1111/eff.12654",NA,"64.192205","-21.144340","Salvelinus alpinus"

"110","Genetic and morphometric differentiation among sympatric spawning stocks of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus L.) in Lake Femund, Norway","Journal of Limnology",2004,"Lake Femund, Norway, contains several sympatric ecotypes of whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus L. Deepwater whitefish, river whitefish, and shallow water whitefish can be easily distinguished by spawning habitat and gillraker number. Variation in morphological and ecological characters and allozyme loci from 11 different spawning sites was analysed to compare the ecological polymorphism with possible genetic sub-structuring of whitefish in the lake. Of the individual morphological and ecological characters, gillraker number best separated the spawning populations, followed by body length. In a hierarchical cluster analysis based on gillraker number, body length and age of fish, the four deepwater sites grouped together as well as the three samples from, or closely related to, inlet rivers. The shallow water sites, however, were more dispersed. In the allozyme analysis, nine of the 38 enzyme loci were polymorphic at the 0.95 level. The amount of genetic variation was quite similar among localities with Hexp = 0.046 - 0.066. Allele frequencies differed significantly among localities at all polymorphic loci indicating distinct reproductive isolation between spawning sites. A consensus tree based on genetic distances grouped samples according to spawning depth and trophic morphology rather than regional proximity. All deepwater spawners grouped together with rather high support while geographically adjacent samples differing by their morphology or behaviour were dispersed. The patterns of differentiation based on allozyme variation and morphology are not fully concordant, but still the association between genetic differentiation and morphological and life history variables was highly significant. Thus, the morphological differences are not due to phenotypic plasticity within single spawning populations as is commonly seen in many other fish species. The possible evolutionary origins of reproductively isolated whitefish forms are discussed. The relatively close association between differences in gillraker counts and genetic difference indicates that the present management of Femund whitefish stocks based on gillraker counts is sensible.","10.4081/jlimnol.2004.233","https://lens.org/095-981-291-749-772","62.123590","11.844330","Coregonus lavaretus"
"111","Genetic persistence of an initially introduced brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) population despite restocking of foreign conspecifics","Ecology of Freshwater Fish",2014,"The persistence of the initial genetic structure despite later stocking with foreign conspecifics is
influenced by several factors, leading to different levels of introgression. Stream spawning has been assumed to be
the prevailing recruitment strategy of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.). However, in lakes with limited stream
spawning habitat, but still with high natural recruitment, lake spawning has been proposed. Using fourteen
microsatellites, we assessed the genetic structure in a small allopatric brown trout population in the Lake Skavatn,
located on the Hardangervidda mountain plateau, Norway. A total of 265 brown trout were obtained from the lake
itself, the outlet stream, two tributaries, a littoral sample from a presumed lake spawning site, a suggested stocking
source, and a lake sample from 1967, representing the initial lake population. The six Skavatn samples were best
represented by three genetic components, showing a shift from the initial population, but with no genetic signal
from the suggested stocking source. The littoral sample had the largest similarity to the initial lake population,
possibly indicating the importance of lake spawning in a system where streams offer unpredictable spawning and
rearing conditions. Due to large annual variations in recruitment contributions from the different spawning and
rearing locations, the genetic structure of the lake population probably vary over time.","10.1111/eff.12102","https://doi.org/10.1111/eff.12102","60.115159","7.145258","Salmo trutta"

The only variables strongly related to brook trout natural reproduction were indices of groundwater influence on surface water chemistry, specifically silica and sodium concentrations. This finding supports the hypothesis that lake spawning populations of brook trout are strongly dependent on groundwater seepage for successful reproduction. Spawning habitat in small headwater lakes impounded by beaver activity may be degraded as a result of siltation of nearshore zones and diminished groundwater seepage. Adirondack lakes situated in thick-till basins receive proportionally greater groundwater input than thin-till lake types and thick-till lakes also had the highest proportion of self-sustaining brook trout populations. Acidification is most pronounced in thin-till basins, which also exhibited a low frequency of self-sustaining brook trout populations. Although brook trout fisheries may be maintained in acidic lakes by liming and stocking, the establishment of self-sustaining brook trout populations is not a likely outcome of these management practices. Additionally, there appears to be limited potential for restoration of lake spawning brook trout populations in currently acidic, fishless lakes should acidic inputs decline as a result of reductions in acid-forming emissions.

Poor natural recruitment to the population was associated with low survival during early life stages (before hatching) as shown by the 0.5, 3.5, 0.9 and 1.0% of live embryos found in natural redds during the 1992-1995 period, respectively. The low survival was most likely caused by the combination of shallow spawning areas (<2.0 m) and acidic runoff (pH 4.0-4.8) which overlayed the limed part of the water body during the ice covered period. It is therefore concluded that this type of episodic acidification poses a major threat to lake spawning salmonids, and that it can retard or inhibit biotic recovery towards preacidified conditions expected as a result of liming. Addition of limestone gravel (8-32 mm) onto spawning grounds was an efficient alternative liming strategy as 33-36% live embryos were found in this substrate. Conversely, the trout actively avoided additions of shellsand, a behaviour most likely caused by the small particle size of shellsand (3-7 mm) relative to natural spawning gravel.","10.1023/A:1007456923571",NA,"58.614222","8.037308","Salmo trutta"

Despite strong anthropogenic influences on the species' population dynamics due to cultural eutrophication and oligotrophication, intense fishing, and large-scale stocking, the influence of climate variability associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is apparent in the data set. This influence is significant although large-scale stocking of cold-bred larvae was performed to avoid a mismatch of larvae with their food. The importance of stocking on YCS, however, is unclear and was only detectable when analysing a subset of the data. In addition to climate variability a yet unidentified factor related to zooplankton suitability as food for fish larvae, and density-dependent mortality probably related to cannibalism do significantly influence YCS. The NAO seemed to influence YCS twofold, through temperature effects on egg development time and on larval growth rate. The first of these two mechanisms is related to the NAO via a time lag of 1 year due to the specific mixing dynamics of warm monomictic Lake Constance. Hence, a warm winter in the year before spawning results in earlier hatching of larvae, that is, hatching is decoupled from the actual meteorological conditions. This should make the larvae very prone to mismatch the dynamics of their food. However, we found no evidence for such a mismatch in this 52-year data set.","10.1007/s00442-006-0587-9","https://lens.org/010-322-933-216-001","47.6036595288889","9.4181237457532","Coregonus lavaretus"

mortality was investigated in situ in Lake Michigan where recruitment is below detectable levels
and egg predator abundance is high. Comparisons were made with Lake Champlain where
recruitment is low and egg predator abundance is also low and with Parry Sound (Lake Huron)
where recruitment is moderate and egg predators are in low abundance. A multi-density egg
seeding method (100 to 5000 eggs m2) was used to quantify the effect of physical disturbance
and egg predation on egg loss. Wind fetch was used as an index of physical disturbance and
comparisons across all locations and egg densities suggested that at sites with high wind fetch
(>5 km), physical disturbance may be a greater source of egg loss than predation. When
analyses were limited to those sites having a wind fetch of <5 km, the percentage of eggs
recovered was found to be linearly related to predator density. The strength of this relationship
was based largely on egg recovery at 500 and 1000 eggs m2 because recovery at lower (100, 250
eggs m2) and very high (5000 eggs m2) densities was not significantly related to predator
density. The reason for this is probably that at low egg densities, crayfish Orconectes spp., the
major egg predator at most sites, had difficulty finding and consuming eggs and at high egg
densities they became satiated. Egg loss was directly related to wind fetch for Lake Michigan
and on average six-fold greater than for Parry Sound suggesting that without corresponding
changes in fecundity and age structure, lake trout populations in large lakes like Lake Michigan
are inherently less productive than those from enclosed inland waters.","10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01437.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01437.x","43.85545","-87.08198","Salvelinus namaycush"

An 8-year field study of brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis in an unstratified Adirondack lake revealed that an aggregate measure of chronically stressful summer water temperatures strongly influenced brook trout population-level characteristics. We quantified chronic thermal stress using the cumulative degree-days over which bottom temperatures exceeded a range of thresholds (18-22 degrees C) and found that the strongest relationships were with cumulative degree-days over 20 degrees C (DD>20). Across years with similar brook trout densities, warmer summer water temperatures resulted in decreased brook trout growth, but growth was not reduced in a year with high water temperatures and low density. Maximum stomach fullness was negatively related to water temperature. Reproductive activity was negatively correlated with stressful summer thermal conditions and was less dependent on female brook trout density. Periods of chronically stressful summer water temperatures resulted in the apparent mortality of age-2 and older fish during a moderately stressful summer (156 DD>20) and apparent mortality of age-1 and older fish during the most stressful summer (210 DD>20). In contrast, extensive mortality was not evident in any year-classes when DD>20 was less than 115. Anthropogenic impacts on the thermal conditions of aquatic ecosystems occur at small (hydrology) and large (climate change) spatial extents, and in situ studies at the margin of an organism's thermal range can provide important insights into changes that will occur if temperatures increase.","10.1577/T08-185.1",NA,"43.966280","-74.870320","Salvelinus fontinalis"

Egg mortality and predator densities were evaluated with collection bags that were buried above the drop-off on spawning substrate at 1-, 3, and 9-m depths. Habitat selection by spawning lake trout was probably related to the coverage by periphyton and zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha given that abiotic characteristics of the spawning habitat such as slope (55-65 degrees), interstitial depth (30-50 cm), and substrate type did not differ across depths. The results of seeding eggs during spawning and recovering them throughout the incubation period (2-177 d) indicated that egg mortality was extremely high early in the spawning period: over 40% of seeded eggs were lost by 2 d and over 80% of the eggs were lost after only 2 weeks. The rate of egg loss declined significantly after the spawning period, possibly as a result of declining water temperature, which caused reduced predator activity, and ice cover, which reduced the impact of physical disturbance. The greatest proportions of seeded eggs were recovered at the shallowest depths (12.5 +/- 1.2% [mean +/- SE] at 1 m and 9.0 +/- 1.5% at 3 m), where predator densities averaged 11.4 +/- 1.8/m(2); a significantly smaller proportion was recovered at 9 In (3.9 +/- 1.2), where predator densities were highest (22.3 +/- 2.0/m(2)). Because lake trout preferred the shallowest depth for spawning and predation was lowest at this depth, we conclude that this strategy improved the probability of egg survival.","10.1577/T04-075.1",NA,"43.85545","-87.08198","Salvelinus namaycush"

of changes in the age structure of the stock. We found a clear relation of spawning time to the mean age of the annual

in relation to the number of female spawners and may serve as an early indicator for stock size changes. The proportion
of viable eggs on the lake floor correlates with oxygen concentrations in deep water. Extremely low oxygen conditions

that cause mortality of Lake Trout embryos could be used simultaneously with gill netting to enhance suppression.
Our objective was to evaluate the in-situ efficacy of two benthic suffocation methods—tarping with gas-impermeable
tarps and Lake Trout carcass deposition to increase the mortality of Lake Trout embryos. Tarping did not increase
embryo mortality; mean control mortality was 21 ± 1.9% (mean ± SE), and mean tarp-treatment mortality was
20 ± 2.9%. Lake Trout carcass deposition caused 98 ± 1.2% mean mortality of embryos at the substrate surface and
100 ± 0.1% mean mortality of embryos 20 cm below the substrate surface. Hypoxic conditions in the carcass treatments
were probably the cause of the high embryo mortality; dissolved oxygen concentrations at the substrate surface
declined from 7.74 to 0.06 mg/L when carcasses remained on the treatment locations. The deposition of Lake Trout
carcasses shows potential to be an additional suppression method that can induce mortality in Lake Trout embryos

We assessed whether lake trout spawning habitat, typically characterized as wave-swept shoals with clean cobble that face predominant wind directions, is similar for a northern lake. Specifically, we examined a dozen sites around Alexie Lake, Northwest Territories, to test if physical habitat and wind exposure were important determinants of spawning site use and embryonic survival. Spawning occurred in similar to 2 m water depth, on 3-15 cm diameter clean substrate found on the leading edge of shoals that ended in a rock crib rising abruptly in nearshore regions around the lake. Wind direction was predominantly from the west, although it was highly variable within and among spawning seasons. We found evidence of lake trout spawning at each site examined, but not limited to shoals facing a predominate wind direction. High variation in embryonic survival (2-83%) from incubation trays was observed among spawning sites, suggesting a large gradient in habitat quality exists within a given lake. Modelled wind exposure did not predict embryonic survival, nor did physical characteristics that may influence interstitial water flow on spawning shoals. Our findings challenge the conventional role of wind as a predominant predictor of lake trout spawning site quality. We propose that the unpredictable nature of wind and abundance of suitable habitat may favour lake-wide spawning by lake trout as a bet-hedging strategy in northern lakes with limited fetch.

"145","Lake trout in northern Lake Huron spawn on submerged drumlins","Journal of Great Lakes Research",2014,"Recent observations of spawning lake trout Salvelinus namaycush near Drummond Island in northern Lake Huron
indicate that lake trout use drumlins, landforms created in subglacial environments by the action of ice sheets, as
a primary spawning habitat. From these observations, we generated a hypothesis that may in part explain locations
chosen by lake trout for spawning. Most salmonines spawn in streams where they rely on streamflows
to sort and clean sediments to create good spawning habitat. Flows sufficient to sort larger sediment sizes are
generally lacking in lakes, but some glacial bedforms contain large pockets of sorted sediments that can provide
the interstitial spaces necessary for lake trout egg incubation, particularly if these bedforms are situated such that
lake currents can penetrate these sediments. We hypothesize that sediment inclusions from glacial scavenging
and sediment sorting that occurred during the creation of bedforms such as drumlins, end moraines, and eskers
create suitable conditions for lake trout egg incubation, particularlywhere these bedforms interactwith lake currents
to remove fine sediments. Further, these bedformsmay provide high-quality lake trout spawning habitat at
many locations in the Great Lakes and may be especially important along the southern edge of the range of the
species. A better understanding of the role of glacially-derived bedforms in the creation of lake trout spawning

We developed high-resolution substrate and bathy-metric maps for Julian's and Waukegan reefs using geo-referenced bathymetry readings, sidescan sonar, and underwater video. Spawning activity was evaluated at suitable and unsuitable habitat using egg traps deployed during the 2009 and 2010 spawning seasons.

Small, discrete areas with suitable spawning habitat (substrate and slope) were found and in total constituted <1% of all hard surfaces mapped at both the Waukegan Reef complex and Julian's Reef.

As predicted at the time of introduction, it quickly expanded its range in Lake Michigan and has recently been documented in Grand Traverse Bay near Elk Rapids, Michigan. Its effects on Great Lakes ecosystems, however, remain unclear owing to a lack of information on its abundance. Using a gear intended to sample lake trout and lake whitefish eggs from cobble substrate during spawning, we found variable densities of Hemimysis at three near shore reefs at Elk Rapids, Lake Michigan over a two year period. The highest densities of Hemimysis were found at the reef with the highest quality fish (i.e., lake trout and lake whitefish) spawning habitat based on the proportion of rounded cobble and rubble substrates, and the amount of interstitial space. Abundance of Hemimysis on all reefs was highly seasonally dependent, ranging from 0 to 31.4 per m(2). The highest numbers were seen during the fall when water temperatures were between 6 and 12 degrees C. Based on the association of Hemimysis with cobble substrates and the abundance of this type of habitat in northeastern Lake Michigan, we predict substantial expansion of Hemimysis in this area of the lake. Additional evaluation of Hemimysis on fish spawning habitat is needed to determine potential interactions with other Great Lakes biota, particularly larval fish with which they may compete.

"155","Modeling movements of lake charr eggs on spawning grounds","Journal of Great Lakes Research",2021,"Because little is known about the effects of currents on lake charr (Salvelinus namaycush) deposition and
fate of eggs, a method to determine their role in spawning success was developed. It is suggested that an
ideal strategy for lake charr egg survival is to select hydrodynamic conditions that allow for eggs to roll
on lakebed and into void spaces in the substratum, whilst avoiding to be lifted from it. On that basis, egg
movement on spawning grounds were modeled using an approach that combines fluid mechanics and
biology. Wave modeling combined with drag and lift forces and egg parameters were used to propose
both critical entrainment and resuspension velocities as well as a modular range of depths that should
be ideal for lake charr spawning given a certain fetch. Modeling suggested that critical velocities of 4.1
and 10.3 cm/s would cause egg entrainment and resuspension respectively. The model was partially validated
using in situ sampling on three spawning sites in Lake Témiscouata (Québec, Canada). Then, further
model applications were conducted on twelve characterized Great Lakes spawning sites using
data found in the literature. Relation of egg survival and the difference between resuspension depth
and spawning depth at those sites was found to fit y ¼ 66:78e0:13x with a correlation coefficient
r2 ¼ 0:89. The findings provide the first explanation of the impact of currents on lake charr spawning success.

Three charr forms, large, small and dwarf differing in growth rate were recorded in the lake. During the last years, the large form disappeared, the small form became rare and the dwarf form became highly abundant; the proportion of old small and dwarf charr sharply decreased. The dwarf form differs in morphology from the small and large forms, which are morphologically similar. In the summer period of 1997-2001, the large form fed on fish, the small form fed mainly on amphibious insects (chironomid pupae), and the dwarf form fed on amphibious insects and benthos. Presently the small form transited to piscivorous and the dwarf form to predominantly planktivorous feeding. The dwarf form spawns from late July to mid-August at stony sites of underwater shore slope when water temperature is 5.0-6.5 degrees C; laid eggs develop till late November-early December at water temperature decreasing to 3.0-3.5 degrees C. According to data needing verification, the small form spawns in late autumn, but some individuals spawn in summer at the same time as the dwarf form. The results suggest substantial, though incomplete reproductive isolation between the dwarf and the small forms. It is supposed that nowadays the degree of their introgressive hybridization has increased following anthropogenic changes in population structure.","10.1134/S0032945221010021",NA,"56.049796","130.882460","Salvelinus alpinus"
"157","New insight into the spawning behavior of lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, from a recovering population in the Laurentian Great Lakes","ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES",2015,"Spawning behavior of lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, is poorly understood, relative to stream-dwelling salmonines. Underwater video records of spawning in a recovering population from the Drummond Island Refuge (Lake Huron) represent the first reported direct observations of lake trout spawning in the Laurentian Great Lakes. These observations provide new insight into lake trout spawning behavior and expand the current conceptual model. Lake trout spawning consisted of at least four distinct behaviors: hovering, traveling, sinking, and gamete release. Hovering is a new courtship behavior that has not been previously described. The apparent concentration of hovering near the margin of the spawning grounds suggests that courtship and mate selection might be isolated from the spawning act (i.e., traveling, sinking, and gamete release). Moreover, we interpret jockeying for position displayed by males during traveling as a unique form of male-male competition that likely evolved in concert with the switch from redd-building to itinerant spawning in lake trout. Unlike previous models, which suggested that intra-sexual competition and mate selection do not occur in lake trout, our model includes both and is therefore consistent with evolutionary theory, given that the sex ratio on spawning grounds is skewed heavily towards males. The model presented in this paper is intended as a working hypothesis, and further revision may become necessary as we gain a more complete understanding of lake trout spawning behavior.","10.1007/s10641-014-0247-6","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10641-014-0247-6.pdf","44.893166","-82.455855","Salvelinus namaycush"

In both lakes the main breeding season is from mid January to mid February, and in Ullswater spawning takes place in shallow water [less than 7.6 m (25 feet)] on a sandy bottom with stones and weed, at the entrance to a bay. The males in Haweswater first spawn when 3 years old and in Ullswater when 2; and the females first spawn in Haweswater when 4 years old, and in Ullswater when 3. Scales were kept from every fish and were found suitable for age determination. Some Haweswater schelly live for 9 years, but from Ullswater the oldest was 8. The rate of growth of male Haweswater schelly was very well described by the equation: (where lt(=the length at time t) but the curve had to be transposed a further year to describe adequately the Ullswater male schelly growth. It is clear that the rates of growth are similar in the two lakes after the first year, during which it is much faster in Ullswater. A study of the length-weight relation showed that the weight is proportional to the length cubed, and no difference in condition was found between males and females. The schelly egg was found to be slightly sticky, spherical and 2.98 mm in diameter. Some fertilized eggs were kept at various constant temperatures. At 4Â°C and 6Â°C the death rate was low, but was higher at 8Â°C and total mortality occured at 10Â°C. This low upper lethal temperature probably restricts the spawning season to mid-winter and also limits the species' geographical range, as has also been suggested for the char Salvelitms alpinus (L.) whose eggs have similar temperature requirements. Some eggs were reared to adults, and these provided corroboration of the validity of the scales for age determination. Two other points mentioned in this paper were the occasional winter strandings of schelly, and the incidence of a supernumerary pelvic fin.","10.1111/j.1095-8649.1970.tb03267.x","https://lens.org/112-388-527-422-096","54.519424","-2.804747","Coregonus lavaretus"

We tested the hypothesis that these sympatric ecotypes comprise a single panmictic population by assaying variation in morphological traits and at allozyme, mitochondrial and minisatellite DNA loci in fish collected from three stream-spawning and two beach-spawning sites. No morphological traits consistently distinguished the reproductive ecotypes with the exception of the number of anal fin rays which was greater in stream-spawning kokanee. Four of 18 allozyme loci screened were polymorphic, but no significant allele frequency differences were detected among populations within ecotypes or between ecotypes. Similarly, allele frequencies at two minisatellite DNA loci were not significantly different among populations or between ecotypes. By contrast, significant differences in the frequencies of mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (mtDNA RFLP) haplotypes were detected between stream- and beach-spawners, but not among populations within ecotypes. Further, two RFLPs that distinguished stream- and beach-spawning adults were found in juvenile kokanee sampled from the limnetic zone of Okanagan Lake. The two mtDNA RFLPs and a d-loop sequence variant appear to be unique to Okanagan Lake kokanee because we did not observe these haplotypes in sockeye salmon and kokanee sampled outside of Okanagan Lake. Our data suggest that: (i) there is restricted female-mediated gene flow between stream- and beach-spawning kokanee in Okanagan Lake, (ii) the forms have diverged within the lake basin since the retreat of the Wisconsinian glaciers (< approximate to 11 000 years ago), and (iii) distinct reproductive niches may promote divergence in north temperate freshwater fish faunas.","10.1046/j.1365-294X.1997.00213.x",NA,"49.92519","-119.494351","Oncorhynchus nerka"
"161","Post-spawning defence by male brook charr is linked to perceived paternity","ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES",2022,"Salmonine fishes are generally thought not to exhibit male parental care, although brief post-spawning mate-guarding by males is known for a number of species, often for populations where eggs are subjected to intense predation (egg cannibalism). Here, detailed in situ data on the spawning behaviour of male brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis, from a naturally reproducing lake population is used to test whether post-spawning mate guarding (i.e. paternal care) is related to perceived paternity. From video records of spawning events (n = 20), we documented a novel behaviour whereby the dominant male curtails spawning ahead of the female (by similar to 3 s) and immediately inspects the nest. Afterwards, the dominant male significantly reduces courtship behaviour (quivers) but aggressively defends the female with the same intensity as prior to spawning. The duration of mate guarding (range: 3-48 min), however, declined with increasing numbers of peripheral males that had rushed into the nest at spawning. Neither the number of active females present on the spawning grounds nor male body size influenced the amount of time dominant males spent mate guarding. Extensive revisitation (80% of visits) by males to spawning sites and to females during focal sampling bouts highlights the importance of a male's ability to predict female readiness to spawn as a significant component of reproductive success. Thus, dominant males appear to guard females at a cost of acquiring other mating opportunities and adjust the time spent guarding depending upon their perceived paternity.","10.1007/s10641-022-01361-2","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10641-022-01361-2.pdf","45.486483","-78.722233","Salvelinus fontinalis"

"163","Predation by alewives on lake trout fry in Lake Ontario: Role of an exotic species in preventing restoration of a native species","JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH",1995,"Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) restoration efforts in Lake Ontario have resulted in an abundance of spawning fish of hatchery-origin, bur virtually no detectable natural recruitment. One explanation has been predation by non-native alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) on lake trout fry. The purpose of this study was to determine if alewives could be important predators on lake trout fry. In the laboratory, fry behavior was examined to ascertain when fry would be present in the water column during a 24-hour period and to determine the acceptability of fry as food for alewives. In aquaria exposed to ambient light regimes, sac fry activity in the water column was much greater at night than during daylight hours (P < 0.001). In laboratory tanks, lake trout fry (15-34 mm) were aggressively eaten by alewives (118-175 mm). Field studies were conducted at Stony Island Reef Lake Ontario in 1989-1993 to determine whether alewives and fry were present at the same time on the reef if alewives fed when on the reef and if alewives fed upon naturally-produced lake trout fry. Lake trout fry captured in traps indicated that sac and emergent fry were available as prey from the middle of April through the third week of May. The first capture of alewives in gillnets set adjacent to the fry traps was typically in early May and corresponded to the peak capture of sac fry in traps. Food was present in 86% of the 1,239 alewives captured after sunset over the 5-year period. Ten lake trout fry were found in 6 of the 62 alewives captured after sunset on 20 May 1993 at Stony Island Reef; no fry were found in alewife stomachs caught on other dates. Predation by alewives might have caused substantial mortality of lake trout fry from spawning areas in Lake Ontario where alewives were abundant and could also be an important source of mortality in similar areas of Lakes Michigan and Huron. Increased stocking of predatory salmonids to suppress the alewife could enhance survival of fry and speed restoration in Lake Ontario, but suppression seems unlikely under current strategies to manage the alewife as forage for non-native salmonids. In this context, lakewide goals should be re-focused on restoration in localized areas where alewives do not congregate during the spring and predation on lake trout fry would be minimal-such as at offshore shoals.

Efforts to restore a lake trout fishery to Lake Champlain include hatchery stocking and sea lamprey control. Despite these management actions, there is little evidence of recruitment of naturally-produced fish in annual fall assessments. Spawning occurs at Multiple sites lake-wide in Lake Champlain, with extremely high egg and fry densities, yet sampling for juvenile lake trout has only yielded fin-clipped fish. To investigate this recruitment bottleneck, we assessed predation pressure by epi-benthic fish on emergent fry on two spawning reefs and the subsequent survival and dispersal of fry in potential nursery areas. Epi-benthic predators were sampled with 2-h gillnet sets at two small, shallow sites in Lake Champlain throughout the 24-h cycle, with an emphasis on dusk and dawn hours. In total, we documented seven different species that had consumed fry, with consumption rates from I to 17 fry per stomach, Rock bass and yellow perch dominated the near-shore fish community and were the most common fry predators. Predator presence and consumption of fry was highest between 19:00 and 07:00. Predators only consumed fry when fry relative abundance was above a threshold of 1 fry trap(-1) day(-1). We used an otter trawl to sample for post-emergent fry adjacent to the reef, but did not capture any age-0 lake trout. Due to the observed predation pressure by multiple littoral, species on shallow spawning reefs, lake trout restoration may be more successful at deep, offshore sites. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Important interactions between these fishes are possible during the lake trout's first year of life, which could include predation on each other's eggs and larvae, and competition for food resources. We investigated the diets of age-0 lake trout and slimy sculpins on a lake trout spawning reef (Gull Island Shoal) and adjacent nursery area (near Michigan Island) in the Apostle Island region of western Lake Superior during June through September from 1988 through 1991. Organisms in stomachs of 511 lake trout and 562 sculpins were identified and counted. Of the 11 major food types found in age-0 lake trout stomachs from both areas, Mysis was the dominant food item (mean volume in stomachs = 68%) and occurred in about 3/4 of the fish analyzed. Copepods, cladocerans, chironomid pupae, fish, and Bythotrephes were also common in the diet (frequency of occurrence > 4%). Diets of lake trout were more diverse on the reef than on the nursery area where Mysis dominated the diet. Slimy sculpins were only found in lake trout greater than 50 mm. Mysis was an important food item of slimy sculpins over the reef but not over the nursery area, where Diporeia was by far the most important taxon. A variety ofben-thic invertebrates (Asellus, chironomids, benthic copepods, and snails) comprised the bulk of the sculpin diet over the reef. Sculpins also ate lake trout eggs in November. Based on cluster analysis, diets were most similar over the reef where both consumed Mysis, calanoid copepods and chironomid pupae. Diets diverged over the nursery areas where sculpins were strictly benthic feeders and lake trout maintained their planktonic diet. In Lake Superior, where lake trout recruitment through natural reproduction has become well established, the coexistence of the two species appears amicable. However, in other Great Lakes with higher sculpin to lake trout ratios on a reef, the coexistence of the two species may be a bottleneck for age-0 lake trout survival beginning with egg deposition and ending when age-0 lake trout move off the reef and the two species no longer compete for a common food resource.","10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71116-9","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71116-9","47.765779","-87.477192","Salvelinus namaycush"

Among the factors which may affect reproduction, the quality of spawning habitat and selection of good habitat by hatchery-origin lake trout are important for the success of population restoration. Stocked lake trout may be unable to recognize small areas of appropriate spawning substrate. The purpose of this study was to identify characteristics of spawning substrate (e.g., depth, substrate size, reef contour) that are important for spawning site selection by lake trout, and to associate these characteristics with egg incubation success. Six rock piles, 4.5 m in diameter, were constructed 80 m from a natural spawning reef Egg deposition and survival to hatching were measured on and adjacent to the rock piles and on the nearby natural cobble reef Lake trout spawned on all of the rock piles in 1990 and 1991. Few eggs were collected immediately adjacent to the piles. Egg densities on the piles were two to four times lower than on the natural cobble reef that was much larger in area. These data indicate that spawning site selection by lake trout was influenced by substrate size and location. Egg survival was high in incubators buried in rock piles (38-61%) and natural cobble (27-59%), but low in incubators adjacent to the piles (3-10%) and on sandy substrates (9%). Thus, lake trout detected and spawned on small areas of clean cobble that supported egg incubation. Lake trout will use new areas of substrate even when larger natural areas are available within 100 m. This result indicates that lake trout spawning on harbor breakwalls and man-made rubble piles is due to their attraction to clean substrate rather than the absence of natural substrate nearby.",NA,NA,"43.652042","-77.732648","Salvelinus namaycush"

Vendace increased in number between 1998 and 2009 while growth and size at maturity decreased. The relative density of whitefish decreased in the pelagic habitat, whereas growth and size remained the same. Both species exhibited varying year-class strength. Whereas strong year-classes of both species became less frequent after 1980 than before this, this seemed to change after 2000, especially for vendace. Generalised additive models suggested a strong positive relationship between July/August mean air temperature and year-class strength of both vendace and whitefish. Whitefish recruitment was also negatively affected by the new regulation regime implemented since 1981, and positively correlated with water level after hatching and by late ice off. The reason for the diverging impacts of environmental factors on the two species may be that vendace spawn in deeper waters that whitefish do. The results indicate that increasing summer temperatures benefit recruitment of both species, whereas low water level and early ice off will harm whitefish recruitment. Both trends are caused by climate warming. It may be speculated that increased density of the specialised plankton feeding vendace may affect the algal community through increased predation on herbivorous zooplankton and potentially affect the trophic state of the lake.","10.1111/eff.12243",NA,"61.217979","11.863705","Coregonus lavaretus"

subsequent years. The abundance of lake trout spawners without fin clips, which implies that these
fish hatched in the lake, increased throughout the sampling period, whereas the abundance of
hatchery-reared fish (indicated by one or more fin clips) stocked for restoration purposes remained
low. Year-class-specific stock–recruitment analysis suggested that the recruitment of unclipped
spawners was related to the number of eggs planted in previous years rather than to spawning by
the few adult lake trout visiting the reef. Increases in adult fish at Devils Island Shoal were
independent of trends at adjacent sites, where unclipped spawner abundances remained low. Enhanced
survival to hatch and apparent site imprinting of young lake trout make this technique a

In samples obtained by beach scining, electrofishing and gill-netting during 1989â€“1992, yearclasses 1979, 1982, 1985, 1988 and 1991 were much more abundant than their neighbouring year-classes. Correspondingly, in a sample of gillnetted fish from 1979, the year-classes 1973 and 1976 were dominant. Spawning areas in the outlet are virtually absent, and lotic rearing areas for juveniles very restricted. Young-of-the-year immigrated to the lake during the autumn, and juveniles inhabited the restricted littoral cobble areas until they reached a length of about 10â€“12 cm and an age of 3+. Competitive exclusion by dominant year-classes may cause the regular, cyclic oscillations in cohort strength. An abundant year-class of juveniles occupying the restricted suitable lacustrine rearing areas may exclude younger fish by inter-cohort interference. The smaller fish are forced to unsheltered marginal rearing areas where they presumably suffer increased mortality.

"170","Relationship between lake trout spawning, embryonic survival, and currents: A case of bet hedging in the face of environmental stochasticity?","JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH",2014,"Lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, spawning in the Great Lakes occurs primarily on cobble substrate at relatively shallow water depths that can experience strong water currents. Strong currents may limit embryonic survival by damaging or displacing eggs, but may also reduce the accumulation of fine material and limit foraging by potential egg predators. To better understand the importance of currents, we evaluated the role of currents in spawning habitat selection, egg density and survival, and egg predator density at a spawning reef in Lake Champlain (USA). Most spawning occurred one week after the largest storm event associated with the strongest currents and greatest upwelling. Highest spawning activity was associated with a relatively shallow part of the reef that had the highest current velocity and greatest potential for egg displacement. Within the interstices, the survival of naturally deposited eggs was unrelated to the concurrent loss of artificial eggs. We propose that the reproductive strategy of spawning on shallow areas of a reef that have the highest current velocity and high potential for egg loss represents a type of bet hedging to optimize survival of those embryos that remain within interstices. This strategy may have evolved in response to environmental stochasticity that resulted in higher egg survival.

Fish were caught by gillnets of different mesh sizes once a month from April to December 1992. The gonad cycle showed that the spawning period occurred between October to December. Relative fecundity is about 2509 ovules per kg of female fish and ovule mean diameter is 4.7 mm (+/-0.6 mm). Seasonal variations of the sex-ratio (Max. in April = 2.67 and Min. in October = 0.19) indicated the intralake migrations of females and males. The condition coefficients showed higher values for females than males; the maximum was observed in summer for both sexes and the minimum in April and in October for males and females, respectively. Low values of the condition were also observed during the spawning period. High feeding activity was recorded in spring and in December after reproduction; low feeding activity was observed in October during reproduction. Asellus aquaticus was quantitatively the dominant prey from April to September; during the spawning period, S. alpinus consumed its own eggs, particularly in large quantity in December. Daphnia longispina was numerically the dominant prey all over the studied cycle and the electivity (Ivlev Index) of arctic charr on the latter prey ranged from +0.79 to +0.16. During April more than 15 500 individuals of D. longispina per Lo nf fish were found in the guts contents. The selective predation of S. alpinus on benthic (A. aquaticus) and zooplankton prey (D. longispina) indicated that the fish immigrate during their feeding activity from benthic/littoral to the pelagic area.

Eggs were scattered over a boulder-strewn bottom. There was neither redd construction nor site preparation. The eggs were relatively large (5.08 mm) and negatively buoyant. Females had approximately 2,500 eggs/kg of body weight. In hatchery tests eggs eyed in about 50 days and hatched in 79â€“122 days at mean water temperatures ranging from 11.0â€“3.0 C.

Our data support the hypothesis that the females matured sexually at the age that maximizes their fitness within the constraints imposed by growth and survival. The two female morphs appeared not to have equal fitness; these differences may be due to random events. The males were more heterogeneous by size than the females when maturing sexually.

The amount of time males and females remained on the spawning grounds increased with body size; however, males were present over a longer period than females of equivalent size. A distinct seasonal peak in spawning activity (similar to 15 d) accounted for 58 and 84% (1994 and 1995) of all reproduction and was coincident with a decline in water temperature below 11 degrees C and increased rainfall. Selection of redd sites by female brook trout was determined by groundwater flow which was significantly greater than at nonspawning sites. A preference for certain redd sites was observed, with 50% of spawnings occurring at 11 sites. The construction of multiple redds and duration in spawning activity by females increased with body size.

Gillnetting is used to suppress adult Lake Trout; however, methods are being developed to suppress embryos, including adding Lake Trout carcasses and carcass-analog pellets to spawning sites. Decomposing carcasses and analog pellets cause decreased dissolved oxygen concentrations thereby leading to Lake Trout embryo mortality, but the effects of these methods on primary producers are unknown. We deployed in-situ nutrient diffusing substrates (NDS) at 3 spawning sites. The 1(st) site was treated with carcasses, the 2(nd) site was treated with analog pellets, and a 3(rd) lacked treatment (control). To estimate how suppression measures may alter nutrient limitation, we measured algal biomass in 6 NDS amendments at each site: nothing (control), N, P, N + P, ground carcasses, or pulverized analog pellets. We deployed 5 replicates of each amendment at each site before and after treating whole sites. N and P co-limited periphyton before carcasses or analog pellets were added to spawning sites (p < 0.01); however, nutrients were not limiting after the treatments were added to spawning sites (p = 0.31-1). Algal biomass was 4x higher after whole-site carcass treatments. In contrast, analog pellets appeared to suppress algal biomass in the amendments (20% of NDS at the control site post-treatment) and in the treatment plot (33% of pre-treatment biomass at analog pellet site). We also measured how individual ingredients in analog pellets altered periphyton biomass, which suggested that vitamin E, estrogen, and soybean oil ingredients reduced the growth of primary producers. Suppression methods may stimulate or reduce algal biomass, depending on the methods used, which could have cascading effects on food webs and potentially reduce the success of the control measures. Estimating how different Lake Trout suppression methods may alter basal resources in the littoral zone of Yellowstone Lake will help natural resource agencies develop effective plans to control invasive predators at early life stages while minimally altering ecosystems.","10.1086/718647",NA,"44.455003","-110.360777","Salvelinus namaycush"

In Yellowstone Lake (Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming), invasive lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) have been the target of a population suppression program for over two decades. For this form of management, the reproductive period is particularly important because fish migrate to and from spawning grounds. From 2011 to 2014, adult lake trout (n = 317) in Yellowstone Lake were tracked using acoustic biotelemetry. After controlling for spatial and temporal dependency in the data, total abundance of unique individuals was estimated where migratory trajectories occurred at confirmed spawning sites. Aggregations and migratory trajectories were further estimated at locations where spawning had not previously been observed. Across years, the greatest number of individuals was observed along a migration corridor in the southwestern area of the lake. Novel strategies for analyzing acoustic telemetry data provided insights into the behavior of an invasive fish species.

Abundance of crayfish ranged from a high of 9.5/m(2) in eastern Lake Ontario to 0/m(2) in western Lake Ontario where the absence or near absence at four reefs sampled was attributed to cold water upwelling. Sculpin abundance ranged from 4.2 to 50.1/m(2). Mean daily egg consumption (eggs/stomach) for sculpins 50 to 75 mm in length, ranged from 0 to 0.9 but differences among reefs were not significant. At one reef significantly more eggs (2.5 eggs/stomach) were consumed by large sculpins (>75 mm) than by small (44-49 mm) sculpins (0.2 eggs/stomach). Estimated egg consumption (eggs/stomach/m(2)) for sculpins >43 mm for the eight reefs for the period between estimated date of peak lake trout spawning and a standardized 30-d period post spawning, ranged from 0 to 496 eggs/m(2) consumed or from 0 to 54% of estimated egg abundance. No lake trout eggs were found in crayfish stomachs, because of their mode of feeding. Estimated egg consumption by crayfish was indirectly estimated from a relationship developed between carapace length and egg consumption using published literature and experimental work. Using this procedure, estimated egg consumption by crayfish for a standardized 30-d period after the date of peak spawning ranged from 0 to 65 eggs/m(2) consumed, or from 0 to 82% of potential egg abundance for the eight reefs. At low egg abundance (<100/m(2)), the density of crayfish and sculpin observed in Lake Ontario could result in sufficient egg consumption to cause almost 100% mortality of lake trout eggs. At higher egg abundance, however, mortality due to crayfish and sculpins appears to be relatively low. Deposition was sufficiently low at 5 of 8 sites to suggest the possible importance of sculpin and crayfish predation on lake trout recruitment failure in Lake Ontario.","10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70595-9",NA,"43.652042","-77.732648","Salvelinus namaycush"

The two morphs are reproductively isolated in time and place of spawning, and are referred to as the littoral and profundal morphs (L-morph and P-morph) according to their spawning habitats. Fish were sampled monthly (ice-free season) or bimonthly (winter) using gillnets in the main lake habitats. The spatial range of the P-morph was restricted to the profundal zone throughout the whole annual period. The L-morph in contrast utilized all main habitats, exhibiting distinct seasonal and ontogenetic variations in habitat distribution. In the spring, the whole L-morph population was located along the bottom profile of the lake, in profundal and littoral habitats. During summer and autumn, habitat segregation occurred between different life-stages, juveniles mainly utilizing the profundal, pre-adults the pelagic and adult fishes the littoral zone. During winter the whole population was assembled in the littoral habitat. The L-morph also had large seasonal and ontogenetic variations in their feeding ecology, with littoral zoobenthos, zooplankton and surface insects being important prey. The P-morph had a narrower diet niche mainly consisting of chironomid larvae and other profundal zoobenthos. Hence, the two Arctic charr morphs exhibited a consistent resource differentiation during all annual seasons and throughout their life cycles, except for a dietary overlap between P-morph and juvenile L-morph charr in the profundal during summer. The findings are discussed in relation to resource polymorphism and incipient speciation.","10.1007/s10641-007-9262-1","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10641-007-9262-1.pdf","69.083979","19.339072","Salvelinus alpinus"

The failure of early attempts to reestablish self-sustaining populations of lake trout was attributed partly to the practice of stocking hatcheryreared juveniles at locations and over substrates that had not been used in the past for spawning by native fish. Subsequent attempts to improve the selection of stocking locations were impeded by the lack of reliable information on the distribution of substrates on historical spawning grounds. Here we demonstrate the potential of side-scan sonar to substantially expand the data base needed to pinpoint the location of substrates where lake trout eggs, fry, or juveniles could be stocked to maximize survival and help ensure that survivors returning to spawn would encounter suitable substrates.

Conventional methods used to monitor these events are often unable to assess the spawning activity directly or can be invasive and therefore problematic. This is especially the case when threatened fish populations are the study subject, such as the Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) populations in Windermere (Cumbria, UK). Arctic charr populations have been studied in this lake since the 1940s, and the locations and characteristics of spawning grounds have been described in detail using techniques such as hydroacoustics, as well as physical and visual surveys of the lake bottom. Here, in conjunction with established netting surveys, we added an environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding approach to assess the spatial distribution of Arctic charr in the lake throughout the year to test whether this tool could allow us to identify spawning locations and activity. Sampling was carried out between October 2017 and July 2018 at three locations in the lake, covering putative and known spawning sites. eDNA metabarcoding provided accurate spatial and temporal characterization of Arctic charr spawning events. Peaks of Arctic charr relative read counts from eDNA metabarcoding were observed during the spawning season and at specific locations of both putative and known spawning sites. Net catches of mature Arctic charr individuals confirmed the association between the Arctic charr spawning activity and the peaks of eDNA metabarcoding relative read counts. This study demonstrates the ability of eDNA metabarcoding to effectively and efficiently characterize the spatial and temporal nature of fish spawning in lentic systems.","10.1002/edn3.343","https://lens.org/100-281-193-321-395","54.335043","-2.942201","Salvelinus alpinus"

Using ultrasonic telemetry, we identified spatial and temporal distribution patterns by tracking 36 adult lake trout (1,137 relocations). Lake trout rarely occupied depths greater than 30 m and were commonly located in the upper hypolimnion directly below the metalimnion during thermal stratification. After breakdown of the metalimnion in the fall, lake trout primarily aggregated at two spawning sites. Lake trout population characteristics were similar to those of populations within the species' native range. However, lake trout in Lake McDonald exhibited lower total annual mortality (13.2%), later maturity (age 12 for males, age 15 for females), lower body condition, and slower growth than are typically observed in the southern extent of their range. These results will be useful in determining where to target suppression activities (e. g., gillnetting, trap-netting, or electrofishing) and in evaluating responses to suppression efforts. Similar evaluations of lake trout distribution patterns and population characteristics are recommended to increase the likelihood that suppression programs will succeed.","10.1080/02755947.2011.562765",NA,"48.590548","-113.912717","Salvelinus namaycush"

Juvenile lake trout have been stocked into Lake Michigan since 1965, but to date there has been limited evidence of spawning by adult feral fish on natural reefs. Although the restoration effort has focused on historically-used offshore spawning reefs in the last decade, the only study of spawning on a deep reef in Lake Michigan failed to find any evidence of egg deposition. Working on the hypothesis that stocked lake trout may be spawning on shallow reefs, the nearshore area of southwestern Lake Michigan was surveyed to locate areas of cobble substrate. The few areas of cobble substrate which were found appeared to provide marginal habitat for overwinter egg incubation, due to the lack of interstitial depth. Egg nets and traps were set on several reefs in the fall; eggs were recovered from four of six sites in 1991 and from three of four sites in 1992. The highest numbers of eggs were collected on a breakwall in Indiana (1 egg/net/day). All sites where eggs were found were less than 12 m deep and within 4 km of shore. Despite the recent focus of stocking and management efforts on deep, offshore reefs in Lake Michigan, lake trout spawn in shallow water. Imprinting to spawning sites does not explain this behavior. Spawning on the breakwall suggests that there is a paucity of good substrate in southern Lake Michigan.

The ecosystem underwent a catastrophic transformation as a result of the introduction of the chub (Squalius cephalus orientalis Linnaeus, 1758) in the middle of the 20th century and the European perch (Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758) in 2013-2014. According to our studies and collected survey data, the endemic subspecies the Kezenoi-Am trout (Salmo trutta ezenami Berg, 1948), which was previously represented by two sympatric forms spawning in the lake and in brooks, has almost completely disappeared. The multifold increase in the intensity of net fishing is an additional factor promoting the degradation of the ecosystem. At present, the European perch predominates in the reservoir, and the chub is a subdominant species. Native fish species are currently inhabiting the ecosystem periphery. The Caspian gudgeon (Gobio holurus Fowler, 1976) is found only in the lower reaches of the tributaries. The Kezenoi-Am trout has completely disappeared in the lake basin and currently is found presumably only in the upper reaches of the tributaries. Based on an analysis of the literature data on the transformation of similar ecosystems, we argue that the consequences of the degradation of Lake Kezenoi-Am fauna are irreversible; thus, the Kezenoi-Am trout, which is listed in the Red Book, will disappear totally in the coming years.

To examine the survival and development of eggs and fry, incubation studies were conducted from 1989 to 1993 in situ on Yorkshire Bar and in the laboratory with untreated surface water from Lake on the Mountain. Eggs were collected at spawning time (16 October-9 November, median 24 October) from Lakes Ontario and Manitou, fertilized, and held individually for an average of 162 days in 290 50-cell Plexiglas incubation chambers. On Yorkshire Bar, significantly more eggs died (P < 0.001, 1.65x mean absolute difference (<Delta(x)over bar>) = 14%), and regardless of egg source, there were fewer hatched fry than in the laboratory (P < 0.001, 0.63x, <Delta(x)over bar> = 29%); 75% of the fry that hatched died early in the incubation period, and 42% of these completely decomposed and disappeared by the end of the incubation period, leaving empty incubation cells. Significantly fewer live fry were produced on Yorkshire Bar than in the laboratory (11.2% versus 69.2%, <Delta(x)over bar> = 58%). Abundance of live fry was inversely related to cumulative thermal units (CTU). Increased exposure on the bar from 370 to 690 CTU decreased survival from 25% to 0. In eastern Lake Ontario, spawning has been observed at a mean water temperature of 11.5 degrees C (29 October) but ranged between 12.7 degrees C (19 October) and 8.8 degrees C (14 November); fry survival on 1 May from these dates and temperatures would be 10%, 0%, and 21%, respectively. If the mean temperature at spawning were 2 degrees C lower (9.5 degrees C, 9 days later), production of fry on 1 May would be almost double (19% vs. 10%). Spawning at lower temperatures would increase fry production on shoals like Yorkshire Bar. Temperature inversely affects fry survival, especially if the spawning substrate is degraded by organic sedimentation, which causes increased biological oxygen demand and reduces oxygen concentrations.

Results of tagging experiments, of stomach examinations of thousands of charrs, and of the analysis of comprehensive morphometric and meristic data made it easy to separate the dolly varden charrs from the red lake or alpine charrs at Karluk. These species have often been confused with each other, and may show intergradation in other parts of the world. At Karluk, however, the dolly varden charr, Salvelinus malma (Walbaum), is typically anadromous, spawns in streams, and has fewer than 20 gill rakers and fewer than 35 pyloric caeca.

Head morphology in embryos, juveniles and adults revealed the presence of two charr morphotypes, each including two morphs: (1) a benthic morphotype including large benthivorous (LB-) and small benthivorous (SB-) charr, featuring overshot mouth and relatively large pectoral fins, and (2) a pelagic morphotype including planktivorous (PL-) and piscivorous (PI-) charr, featuring terminal mouth and relatively small pectoral fins. SB-charr mature sexually (50%) at 2 (males) and 4 yr (females); asymptotic length is 133 mm. LB-charr mature sexually at 8 yr; asymptotic length is 553 mm. PL-charr mature sexually at 4 (males) and 5 yr (females); asymptotic length is 205 mm. PI-charr mature sexually at 6 yr; asymptotic length is 302 mm. SB- and LB-charr both live in the littoral zone, but they segregate in microhabitat: LB-charr live epibenthically, whereas SB-charr live mainly in the interstitial spaces of the stony substrate. Their diet, however, is similar (Schoener's D = 0.34 - 0.89). Both feed mainly on the snail Lymnaea peregra. PI-charr live mainly epibenthically, feeding on sticklebacks and juvenile charr. PL-charr is the most numerous morph in the lake. It lives both in the pelagic and in the epibenthic zone, feeding on crustacean zooplankton and chironomid pupae. The young of the year of all morphs live in the littoral zone where they feed on chironomid larvae. All morphs spawn in the littoral zone, LB-charr spawn in July-August, PL- and PI-charr spawn in September-November, whereas SB-charr spawn during August to November. Genetically, the morphs are very similar; Nei's genetic distances were between 0.00004 to 0.00126. The only significant difference found was between SB-charr and the other three morphs combined.

In the first year, two of the historically utilized spawning sites (15% of the historic spawning habitat) were covered to prevent spawning fish from using the sites. Lake trout responded by selecting 12 new sites around the lake. In the second year, when an additional 35% of the historic spawning habitat was removed, the density of eggs deposited at the remaining traditional site increased and 8 more new sites were selected. These manipulations produced no detectable change in the timing of spawning and fish appeared to rapidly abandon efforts to use the former sites. This study demonstrates that lake trout will actively seek out alternate spawning sites when traditional habitat is lost. Initial indications are that useable spawning habitat is not limited in Whitepine Lake, but the long-term effects of the selection of alternative sites are not yet known.","10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71111-X",NA,"47.282780","-80.831713","Salvelinus namaycush"

Despite the great interest in characterising fish reproductive habitat, the relationship between the selection of a given spawning site and individual fitness has not been experimentally tested. 2. In this study, we used an in situ experimental approach to determine (i) the relative contribution of substrate characteristics as well as hydrological and physicochemical variables to small-scale redd site selection by brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchill) and (ii) if hatching and emergence success, used as a surrogate of fitness, are improved in selected compared to non-selected sites in both lake and stream habitats. 3. Our results show that upwelling groundwater flow was always significantly higher in selected than in non-selected sites in both lake and stream habitats. We found no significant difference in the mean geometric substrate diameter and no consistent differences in substrate composition between selected and non-selected sites. Oxygen concentration was higher (significantly so in three of four comparisons) and conductivity tended to be lower in selected than in non-selected sites, while temperature showed no significant or consistent variations. We found a significant positive relationship between the selection of a given spawning habitat and hatching and emergence success in these systems. 4. These results show that the main cue that brook charr use to select their spawning sites is upwelling groundwater in lake and stream habitats, and that active selection of these sites increases individual fitness. This suggests that natural selection acted on the same cues in lentic and lotic environments; this could have been highly adaptive in a species that used both habitats as colonisation routes after the last glaciation.","10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02542.x",NA,"47.041791","-72.770926","Salvelinus fontinalis"

success for a population of lake-spawning brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). Three quarters of all spawning
sites were reused by multiple females; however, brood loss was much less (28%–38%) because large females spawned
earlier and constructed deeper nests. The relationship between groundwater flow rate and egg survival was not linear,
with consistent egg survival occurring only at sites with flows over 20 mL·m–2·min–1. Varying scenarios of redd superimposition
and habitat-related egg survival resulted in an estimated 4%–21% of deposited eggs surviving to emergence
and greatly reduced the size-related advantages of larger females owing to fecundity. Limited numbers of high-quality
spawning sites and overall low survival of eggs resulted in habitat being the dominant route of egg loss. In the absence
of female competition, spawning habitat alone accounted for egg losses of 67%–91% and points to the importance of
physical habitat features in the maintenance of brook trout populations.","10.1139/f05-176","https://doi.org/10.1139/f05-176","45.486483","-78.722233","Salvelinus fontinalis"

early November. Of the mature fish collected on or near the spawning grounds,
60 to 69 percent were males. Among mature fish the average length of females
was greater than that of males; few males less than 24 inches or females less than
26 inches in total length were caught. Recoveries of lake trout tagged on the
spawning grounds showed that some males remained in the immediate area for
a period of several weeks during the spawning season. Marked fish showed a
tendency to return during later years to spawning grounds on which they had
been tagged, even though many of them ranged long distances between spawning
seasons.
The percentage of the total weight composed by gonads of maturing females
collected in 1950 was 5.0 percent on August 11-30 and 12.3 percent on October
6-9, but this increase was not accompanied by an increase in the coefficient of
condition.
One volumetric and two gravimetric methods for estimating numbers of eggs

the drying of eggs in an oven before weighing on an analytical balance. Production
of eggs by 70 lake trout ranging from 2S.1 to 38.0 inches in total
length and from 5.S to 19.6 pounds in weight ranged from 2,476 to 17,119.

These findings suggest that PAM over Arctic Charr spawning grounds could provide meaningful information to be used in developing management plans for this threatened species, such as determining the location and time of arrival, diel pattern and length of spawning activities.","10.1080/09524622.2017.1286263",NA,"54.335043","-2.942201","Salvelinus alpinus"

"210","Traditional ecological knowledge reveals the extent of sympatric lake trout diversity and habitat preferences","ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY",2017,"Multidisciplinary approaches to conservation have become increasingly important in northern regions. Because many First Nations communities have relied on freshwater fish populations for essential food over millennia, community members often possess traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). We consulted Cree First Nation fishers to collate TEK for one of Canada's most important subsistence fishes (lake trout) in Quebec's largest lake (Mistassini, 2335 km(2)). We further integrated TEK with what was regionally known scientifically about the species, toward effective fisheries conservation. Cree fishers described a richer diversity of sympatric lake trout forms than did scientific research that was conducted simultaneously, based on color, size, fin accent patterns, scale texture and depth, and spatial preferences. Traditional ecological knowledge also provided descriptions of lake trout seasonal movements, spawning locations, and reproductive timing that were not captured by scientific research, and highlighted several concerns or temporal changes of import to future management initiatives. Our study highlights the wealth of TEK on harvested species in First Nations communities. It further illustrates how TEK can reveal not only distinctions within species of relevance to natural resource management and taxonomy, but also informs upon the extent of such population differentiation, thereby providing important conservation benefits for remote and northern regions.","10.5751/ES-09345-220220",NA,"50.911330","-73.721069","Salvelinus namaycush"

The main objectives were to; first, evaluate the disk trap as a device for sampling lake trout eggs in the Great Lakes, and second, summarize what has been learned about lake trout spawning through the use of disk traps. Of the 5,085 traps set, 60% were classified as functional when retrieved. Evidence of lake trout egg deposition was documented in each of the lakes studied at 14 of 29 sites. A total of 1,147 eggs were trapped. The percentage of traps functioning and catch per effort were compared among sites based on depth, timing of egg deposition, distance from shore, size of reef and type of reef(artificial or natural). Most eggs were caught on small, shallow, protected reefs that were close to shore. Use of disk traps on large, shallow, unprotected offshore reefs or along unprotected shorelines was generally unsuccessful due to the effects of heavy wind and wave action. Making multiple lifts at short intervals, and retrieval before and re-deployment after storms are recommended for use in exposed al eas. On large reefs, preliminary surveys to identify preferred lake trout spawning habitat may be required to deploy disk traps most effectively. Egg deposition by hatchery-reared fish was widespread throughout the Great Lakes, and the use of artificial structures by these fish was extensive.","10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71115-7",NA,"44.893166","-82.455855","Salvelinus namaycush"

"215","Use of Small Streams by Young Brook Trout Spawned in a Lake","Transactions of the American Fisheries Society",1997,"Abstract Young-of-the-year (age-0) brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis that were spawned in a lake were observed migrating into and inhabiting small (<2-m-wide) inlet streams. We estimated that up to 81% of the entire age-0 population in the lake system inhabited the streams by midsummer. Some age-0 fish overwintered in the streams and remained there during their second summer. Such behavior suggested fitness advantages were gained by stream residence. The inhabited streams had accessible, cold, and stable habitats that existed because the streams occurred in forested catchments where groundwater dominated base flows. This identification of these small streams as habitat for young brook trout and the importance of catchment hydrology for sustaining these habitats indicated a need to review habitat protection guidelines for lake-dwelling populations.","10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0077:uossby>2.3.co;2",NA,"45.300295","-78.132383","Salvelinus fontinalis"

Nine locations examined north of Saginaw Bay in the northwestern end of the lake are thought to provide the best spawning habitat. The substrate at these sites consisted of angular rough cobble and rubble with relatively deep interstitial spaces (â‰³0.5 m), small amounts of fine sediments, and little or no periphytic growth. Conditions at the three other sampling locations south of Saginaw Bay seemed much less suitable for successful reproduction based on the reduced area of high-quality substrate, shallow interstitial spaces, high infiltration of fine sediments, and greater periphytic growth.","10.1577/1548-8659(1987)7<418:voohlt>2.0.co;2","https://lens.org/070-983-242-633-003","44.893166","-82.455855","Salvelinus namaycush"
"217","Warming winters threaten peripheral Arctic charr populations of Europe","CLIMATIC CHANGE",2020,"As the global climate warms, the fate of lacustrine fish is of huge concern, especially given their sensitivity as ectotherms to changes in water temperature. The Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinusL.) is a salmonid with a Holarctic distribution, with peripheral populations persisting at temperate latitudes, where it is found only in sufficiently cold, deep lakes. Thus, warmer temperatures in these habitats particularly during early life stages could have catastrophic consequences on population dynamics. Here, we combined lake temperature observations, a 1-D hydrodynamic model, and a multi-decadal climate reanalysis to show coherence in warming winter water temperatures in four European charr lakes near the southernmost limit of the species' distribution. Current maximum and mean winter temperatures are on average similar to 1 degrees C warmer compared to early the 1980s, and temperatures of 8.5 degrees C, adverse for high charr egg survival, have frequently been exceeded in recent winters. Simulations of winter lake temperatures toward century-end showed that these warming trends will continue, with further increases of 3-4 degrees C projected. An additional 324 total accumulated degree-days during winter is projected on average across lakes, which could impair egg quality and viability. We suggest that the perpetuating winter warming trends shown here will imperil the future status of these lakes as charr refugia and generally do not augur well for the fate of coldwater-adapted lake fish in a warming climate.","10.1007/s10584-020-02887-z","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10584-020-02887-z.pdf","45.739263","5.867691","Salvelinus alpinus"
